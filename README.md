# Anti-Plagiarism
This was a small project I worked on for my programming teacher; he wanted a way to easily find programs that were suspect of plagiarism, but didn't want to work on it. I took the initiative and designed it with Java projects in mind, though it should be expandable to a degree for other languages.

It is quite an old project of mine that I haven't touched, so bear in mind that the code isn't particularly elegant.
